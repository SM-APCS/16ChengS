    /* First we start off with a scanner to ask for a sentence
    then we set around the scanner a while loop to ask if you want to play again
    After this, there is a second file that is the actual translator that takes
    apart the sentence using substring and concatenating ay to the end of word along 
    with the substring infront of "ay"
    There needs to be a method that included words that start with vowels, or two
    letter start ups. 
    Once this occurs, you then go back to the translate method and set up an if 
    statement that has the condition to check whether or not the word/sentence 
    starts with a vowel.
